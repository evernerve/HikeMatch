# Quick Fix for Your Duplicate Connections

## Run the Cleanup Script

Since you already have duplicate connections, follow these steps to clean them up:

### Step 1: Install tsx (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -D tsx
```

### Step 2: Add script to package.json

Open `package.json` and add this to the `"scripts"` section:

```json
"cleanup-connections": "tsx scripts/cleanupDuplicateConnections.ts"
```

### Step 3: Run the cleanup
```bash
npm run cleanup-connections
```

### Expected Output:
```
🔍 Scanning for duplicate connections...

📊 Total connections found: 24

⚠️  Found 2 duplicate connections:
   User: user123abc
   Connected to: user456def
   Document IDs: conn_xyz123, conn_xyz456
   🗑️  Deleting 1 duplicate(s)...
   ✅ Deleted: conn_xyz456

============================================================
📈 SUMMARY
============================================================
Total connections scanned: 24
Duplicate sets found: 1
Duplicate documents removed: 1
Connections remaining: 23
============================================================

✅ Cleanup complete! Your connections are now deduplicated.

🎉 Script completed successfully!
```

## Alternative: Manual Firestore Cleanup

If you prefer to clean up manually through Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Open the `connections` collection
3. Find duplicate entries (same `userId` and `connectedUserId`)
4. Delete the newer duplicates (check `connectedAt` timestamp)

## After Cleanup

1. Refresh your app
2. Go to Connections page
3. Verify you see each friend only once
4. The fix prevents future duplicates!

## What the Fix Does

Going forward, the app now:

✅ **Auto-connects** when both users send requests to each other
- If User B already sent you a request, sending one to them instantly connects you both!

✅ **Prevents duplicates** even if both accept simultaneously
- Only one connection pair is created

✅ **Better feedback**
- Shows "🎉 You're now connected!" when auto-accept happens
- Clear messages for all scenarios

## Testing the Fix

Try with a friend:

**Test 1: Normal flow**
```
1. You send request to friend
2. Friend accepts
3. ✅ Both see each other once in connections
```

**Test 2: Simultaneous sends (the cool part!)**
```
1. You send request to friend
2. Friend sends request to you (before seeing yours)
3. ✅ System auto-connects you both instantly!
4. ✅ No duplicate
```

**Test 3: Race condition**
```
1. You both send requests to each other
2. You both click accept at the same time
3. ✅ Only one connection created
4. ✅ No duplicate
```

You should now have a duplicate-free connections list! 🎉
