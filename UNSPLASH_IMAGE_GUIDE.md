# Unsplash Image Search Guide

## Quick Fix Applied ‚úÖ

The Unsplash image search has been updated to show **curated high-quality images** instead of the deprecated source.unsplash.com API.

## How It Works Now

When you search with Unsplash:
1. Click **"üîç Search Images"** on any image field
2. Select **UNSPLASH** tab
3. Click **Search** (the query is pre-filled with your item name)
4. You'll see 8 curated nature/outdoor images
5. Click any image to select it

## Why Curated Images?

The old Unsplash Source API (`source.unsplash.com`) has been deprecated. Instead of broken image links, we now show:
- 8 beautiful, high-quality outdoor/nature photos
- Perfect for hiking trails, restaurants, and general use
- Direct Unsplash photo URLs that work reliably
- Images are pre-selected from Unsplash's best collection

## Example Images Shown

The search now displays curated images featuring:
- üèîÔ∏è Mountain landscapes
- üå≤ Forest scenery  
- üåÖ Sunsets and peaks
- üåø Nature and outdoor views
- üèûÔ∏è Scenic landscapes

All images are from Unsplash's permanent collection with stable URLs.

## For Specific Images

### Option 1: Use Direct URL (Recommended)
1. Go to [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)
2. Search for your exact item (e.g., "Hofbr√§uhaus M√ºnchen", "Partnachklamm")
3. Click on an image you like
4. Right-click ‚Üí Copy Image Address
5. In your app, click **"üîç Search Images"** ‚Üí **DIRECT URL** tab
6. Paste the URL
7. Click **Use URL**

**Example Unsplash URL format:**
```

```

### Option 2: Wikipedia
1. Click **"üîç Search Images"**
2. Select **WIKIPEDIA** tab
3. Enter the exact name (e.g., "Hofbr√§uhaus")
4. Search will find images from Wikipedia article

### Option 3: Get Unsplash API Key (Advanced)
To enable real Unsplash search:

2. Create an app to get an Access Key
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
   ```
4. Update `ImageSearchModal.tsx` line 86:
   ```typescript
   client_id=${import.meta.env.VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY}
   ```

## Best Practices

### For Hiking Trails
‚úÖ **Good searches:**
- Search Wikipedia for specific trail names
- Use direct Unsplash URLs for exact locations
- Curated images work great for generic mountain/forest trails

### For Restaurants  
‚úÖ **Good sources:**
- Direct URLs from restaurant websites
- Google Maps/Reviews images (right-click ‚Üí copy image address)
- Unsplash for general restaurant ambiance

### For Movies/TV Shows
‚úÖ **Best option:**
- Use Direct URL with poster from IMDb, TMDb, or official sources
- Wikipedia often has promotional images

## Current Status

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Unsplash Curated Images | ‚úÖ Working |
| Wikipedia Search | ‚úÖ Working |
| Direct URL | ‚úÖ Working |
| TMDB API | ‚è≥ Requires API key |
| Unsplash API Search | ‚è≥ Requires API key (optional) |

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "Images don't match my search"
- **Solution:** The curated images are generic. Use Direct URL or Wikipedia for specific results.

**Problem:** "I need the exact restaurant/trail photo"
- **Solution:** Use Direct URL tab and paste the specific image URL from the source.

**Problem:** "Can I upload my own photos?"
- **Solution:** Upload to an image host (like imgur.com), then use Direct URL.
